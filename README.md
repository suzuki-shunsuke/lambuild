# lambuild

_Lambda => CodeBuild = lambuild_

Trigger AWS CodeBuilds build with dynamic configuration based on the content of event and associated pull request with GitHub Webhook and Lambda Function.

## Motivation

When we use CodeBuild's Batch Build, we want to change the build configuration base on the content of event and associated pull request.
This is especially important for _Monorepo_.
For example, we want to run the build `test_foo` only when the service `foo` is updated in the associated pull request.
But CodeBuild doesn't support such a feature, so we develop `lambuild`.

## Architecture

```
User = (push, pull_request) => GitHub = (webhook) => API Gateway => Lambda => CodeBuild
```

## How to work

1. Lambda Functions is called via GitHub Webhook
1. Request is filtered with hook configuration
1. Configuration file is downloaded from the source repository
1. buildspec is generated
1. Build or Batch Build is run

## Supported GitHub Event

* [push](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/webhooks-and-events/webhook-events-and-payloads#push)
* [pull_request](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/webhooks-and-events/webhook-events-and-payloads#pull_request)
