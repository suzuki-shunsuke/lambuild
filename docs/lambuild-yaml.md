# lambuild.yaml

`lambuild` gets a configuration file from a source repository and generates buildspec.
We call this configuration file as `lambuild.yaml`, but we can change the filename and path freely.

`lambuild` generates buildspec based on `lambuild.yaml`, so the format of `lambuild.yaml` is based on buildspec.
